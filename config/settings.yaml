  # Your value proposition for the AI to use
  value_proposition: |
    I build fully automated outbound systems for agencies. The system finds
    ideal clients, researches them, writes personalized emails, sends sequences,
    and books calls—all automatically. It's like hiring a salesperson for a
    fraction of the cost. This very email is proof it works.
