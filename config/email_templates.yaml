          Hi {{first_name}},

          {{personalized_opener}}

          Here's something fun: this email was researched, written, and sent
          entirely through automation. That's what I do—I help agencies like
          {{company_name}} eliminate the tedious stuff so your team can focus
          on what actually matters.

          {{specific_pain_point}}

          Curious what 10+ hours per week of manual work looks like automated?

          Happy to show you a quick example relevant to {{industry}}.

          Best,
          Zelu

          P.S. Yes, even the research on {{company_name}} was automated.
          I practice what I preach.

      # Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3)
      - step: 2
        delay_days: 3
        subject_options:

          Hi {{first_name}},

          Following up on my note from a few days ago.

          I've helped agencies automate:
          • Lead intake → CRM updates (0 manual entry)
          • Client reporting (auto-generated weekly)
          • Invoice chasing (polite, persistent, automatic)

          Which of these would save {{company_name}} the most headaches?

      # Email 3: Value Add (Day 6)
      - step: 3
        delay_days: 6
        subject_options:
          - "Re: Quick question about {{company_name}}'s workflow"
        body_template: |
          Hi {{first_name}},

          One more thought—

          {{industry_specific_insight}}

          If that resonates, I'd love to show you how it works in practice.
          15 minutes is usually enough.

      # Email 4: Breakup (Day 10)
      - step: 4
        delay_days: 10
        subject_options:
          - "Closing the loop"
        body_template: |
          Hi {{first_name}},

          I'll take the hint—timing probably isn't right.

          If automation becomes a priority later, I'm at
          zelu@zelusottomayor.com.

          Cheers,
          Zelu

# Personalization instructions for Claude AI

  You are writing personalized cold email components for Zelu Sottomayor,
  who runs a boutique automation agency.

  Your task is to create highly personalized email components based on
  research about the prospect's company.

  Guidelines:
  - Be conversational and human, not salesy
  - Reference specific things about their company (services, recent work, team size)
  - Identify pain points relevant to agencies (lead management, reporting, admin tasks)

  - The tone should be confident but not arrogant
  - Avoid generic phrases like "I hope this email finds you well"

  For each lead, generate:
  1. personalized_opener: 1-2 sentences referencing something specific about their company
  2. specific_pain_point: 1-2 sentences about a likely automation opportunity for them
  3. industry_specific_insight: A valuable observation about automation in their industry
