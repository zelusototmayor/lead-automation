          Hi {{first_name}},

          {{personalized_opener}}

          Here's the thing: this email found you, researched {{company_name}},
          wrote itself, and landed in your inbox—all automatically.

          That's what I build for agencies: fully automated outbound.
          It finds your ideal clients, writes personalized emails, sends them,
          and follows up. You just show up to the calls.

          Think of it as hiring a salesperson for a fraction of the cost—
          one that works 24/7 and never forgets to follow up.

      # Email 2: Follow-up (Day 3)
      - step: 2
        delay_days: 3
        subject_options:
          - "Re: How {{company_name}} found new clients this week"
        body_template: |
          Hi {{first_name}},

          Quick follow-up.

          Most agencies I talk to have the same problem: great at the work,
          but outbound is either inconsistent or eating up hours that should
          go to clients.

          What I usually help agencies with is:
          • Finding companies that match your ideal client profile
          • Researching each one for personalized outreach
          • Sending emails + follow-ups automatically
          • Booking calls directly into your calendar

          You focus on closing and delivering. The machine handles the top of funnel.

          Worth exploring?

      # Email 3: Value Add (Day 6)
      - step: 3
        delay_days: 6
        subject_options:
          - "Re: How {{company_name}} found new clients this week"
        body_template: |
          Hi {{first_name}},

          One more thought—

          {{industry_specific_insight}}

          If outbound isn't the bottleneck right now, I also build custom
          automation for other parts of the business. But for most agencies,
          consistent lead flow is the unlock.

      # Email 4: Breakup (Day 10)
      - step: 4
        delay_days: 10
        subject_options:
          - "Closing the loop"
        body_template: |
          Hi {{first_name}},

          I'll assume the timing isn't right—no worries.

          If automated outbound (or any other automation) becomes relevant
          for {{company_name}} later, the door's open:

          Cheers,

# Personalization instructions for Claude AI
personalization_instructions: |
  You are writing personalized cold email components for Zelu Sottomayor,
  who builds automated outbound systems for agencies.

  The core offer: A fully automated outbound system that finds ideal clients,
  researches them, writes personalized emails, sends sequences, and books calls.
  It's like hiring a salesperson for a fraction of the cost.

  Your task is to create highly personalized email components based on
  research about the prospect's company.

  Guidelines:
  - Be conversational and human, not salesy
  - Reference specific things about their company (services, clients, positioning)
  - Focus pain points on outbound/sales challenges (inconsistent pipeline, time spent on prospecting, feast-or-famine cycles)
  - Keep it concise - these are busy people
  - The tone should be confident but not arrogant
  - Avoid generic phrases like "I hope this email finds you well"

  For each lead, generate:
  1. personalized_opener: 1-2 sentences referencing something specific about their company that shows you did research
  2. specific_pain_point: 1-2 sentences about why automated outbound would help THIS specific agency (based on their size, services, or market)
  3. industry_specific_insight: A valuable observation about outbound/sales in their specific industry vertical (e.g., if they're a PR agency, talk about how PR agencies often rely on referrals and miss opportunities)
